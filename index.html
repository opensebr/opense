                    <h2>About OpenSE 2021</h2>
                        <p>n 2020, the 8th Workshop on Software Visualization, Evolution and Maintenance (VEM 2020) edition will be held, for the first time, in a virtual format. VEM builds upon the success of the first editions of VEM, which in turn followed after two editions of the Brazilian Workshop on Software Visualization (WBVS) and ten editions of the Brazilian Workshop on Software Maintenance (WMSWM).</p>

                    <h2>Aims and Scope</h2>
                    <p>The growing need for maintaining and evolving software systems is a major challenge in modern software engineering. Several studies have shown that maintenance tasks are responsible for a substantial cost in the software development process, sometimes reaching 90% of the total cost. The pressure for faster development and releases of new software versions has also increased the interest in software evolution and maintenance throughout the years. Besides, there is an increasing investment in these activities since the advent of execution environments (e.g., Web computing, ubiquitous computing, and cloud computing), development paradigms (e.g., Feature-Oriented Programming, Service-Oriented Architecture, DevOps) and new types of media (e.g., mobile devices, gesture-based interfaces etc.).

                        In order to perform maintenance and evolution tasks in complex software systems, developers must resort to advanced means for understanding the software artifacts to be modified. Software comprehension, however, is a non-trivial task. In this scenario, software visualization becomes an interesting resource, relying on the use of visual abstractions to facilitate comprehension of software systems under several viewpoints, representing structural, behavioral, and time-based aspects of software. The clear intersection between Software Visualization, Software Evolution, and Software Maintenance led to the creation of an event where researchers can discuss challenges in these fields and work together to overcome them.
                        
                        The 8th Workshop on Software Visualization, Maintenance, and Evolution (VEM 2020) aims at bringing together the research communities interested in topics related to Software Visualization, Software Evolution, and Software Maintenance to share and discuss ideas, reflecting on alternatives to perform visualization, evolution, and maintenance of software systems. VEM is also a great opportunity for strengthening research group collaborations, as well as identifying new research opportunities. VEM is co-located with the 11th Brazilian Conference on Software: Theory and Practice (CBSoft 2020).</p>
